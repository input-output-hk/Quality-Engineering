# Practices & processes dimension

:::warning

[These tables](https://input-output.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CI/pages/3949953189/Practices+Processes+Dimension) could be reformatted to headings to make it easier to read.

:::

## 1 - Reactive

-   There's minimal consistency across teams, leading to siloed efforts, misalignments, redundant work.

-   **Standard processes[\*\*](#core-processes)** are either non-existent or inconsistently applied.

-   Inconsistencies are prevalent across teams in terms of coding practices, repositories structure, and development processes.

-   Dependencies and integrations are typically challenging due to the lack of consistency.

### Improvement Focus

-   Begin documenting current practices, processes, and tools, at the Tribe level, in a common format (Quality Strategy tool - QP, QA, QC).

-   Encourage teams to share and communicate about their processes, practices and tools.

-   Create a baseline understanding of **core processes** at the Tribe level among teams and tribe members.

## 2 - Managed

-   Most **core processes[\*\*](#core-processes)** are set up formally, although they might still be in their infancy and adherence might vary across teams.

-   Some documentation and basic management control (\*2, 3) are established, but there may still be significant variations in adoption, quality, and efficiency.

-   Basic guidelines for repos structure (\*7) are set, but not all teams align.

### Improvement Focus

-   Establish a central team or committee to oversee and guide the standardization efforts.

-   Identify gaps in the **Quality Strategy** and begin to prioritize and address them.

## 3 - Defined

## 4 - Measured

## 5 - Optimized

<small><a id="core-processes">\*\*</a> Some of the core processes at tribe level are: onboarding, software development, CI/CD, documentation, retrospectives, vendor integration, quality strategy, defect/risk triaging, tracking and management.</small>

## Guiding Questions:

1. Are we staying focused on delivering value, or are we being sidetracked by "nice-to-haves"?

1. What are the tribe’s practices related to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks throughout the software development lifecycle? This includes not only technical risks but also project, operational, and business risks.

1. How does the tribe identify, track, prioritize, resolve, automate, and monitor trends of defects?

1. What are the tribe’s practices related to integrating quality (Quality Strategy) and security (secure coding practices, vulnerability assessments, regular security audits, etc) practices into the development process?

1. What are the tribe’s practices related to onboarding tribe members more efficiently?

1. What are the tribe’s practices for CI/CD?

1. What are the tribe’s practices for organizing all the repositories in a consistent way?
