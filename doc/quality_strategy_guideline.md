We extended the traditional test strategy to a quality engineering strategy, which gives proper focus to quality measures to build quality in (preventive), quality measures to demonstrate the quality level (detective), and quality measures to improve the quality (corrective).

The benefit of applying a quality engineering strategy is that a team (or group of collaborating teams) creates easy and clear guidance for everybody involved, about which activities to apply to achieve built-in quality in fit-for-purpose systems. This guidance will have differing focus, some quality measures are linked to individual user stories, other quality measures apply to features or epics and the quality engineering strategy will also contain generic quality measures that the team applies always. Apart from the choice of quality measures, also the stage in which a quality measure is applied matters, especially when multiple teams are involved. In that case, the quality measures are also linked to the relevant fundamental Dev activity (for preventive and corrective quality measures) and to test varieties (for static and dynamic quality measures).
